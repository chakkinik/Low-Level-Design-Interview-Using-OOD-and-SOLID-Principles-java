    /*
      FIVE WHY

      1) Why factory is used.
      -- When you need to create instances of classes that share a common interface or superclass but differ in implementation
      2) why we use only for common interface.
      --The factory will have to deal with very different types, potentially leading to methods that arenâ€™t easily maintainable.
      3)
